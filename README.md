## Getting AdsPower

#### What is AdsPower?
AdsPower is a tool designed to simplify running multiple instances of the Chromium browser while preventing the browsers from leaving detectable fingerprints.

#### What are fingerprints?
In the context of web browsers, fingerprints refer to data shared by the browser that can be used to identify and track multiple accounts being operated on the same device.

##### Some common fingerprints are:
- Ip address, Operating system, User agent, Canvas, Extensions list, Location, TimeZone, Etc.

AdsPower allows you to manipulate and randomize every known type of browser fingerprint, ensuring a unique browsing experience. This is why I highly recommend using this tool to optimize our farming activities.

## Configure AdsPower
To farm extensions, we’ll create multiple profiles. The free version allows up to 5 profiles, but you can extend this by running 5 profiles on each additional VPS you have. Alternatively, you can upgrade to plans supporting 10, 50, or even 100 profiles.

#### Setting Proxies
- For each profile we create, a separate proxy is required to prevent using the same IP address.
- I recommend to use **BartProxies**, [Click here to create your account](https://bartproxies.com/login?referral=DBAhvqij).
- After you created an account go to **PLANS AND PRICING**.

- Use this discount code **BHW625** to apply 60% discount.

#### Once you’ve ordered the proxies from BartProxies, copy the proxy list. Then, in AdsPower, go to the Proxies tab, click on "Add Proxy," and paste the proxy list into the dedicated field.

- Click on “**Check Proxy**” then OK to save them.

## Creating Profiles
- Click on the "**New Profiles**" button. If you have the paid version, you can create profiles in bulk. If not, you'll need to create profiles one by one.
